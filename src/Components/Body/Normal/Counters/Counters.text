To work with CSS counters we will use the following properties:

    counter-reset - Creates or resets a counter
    counter-increment - Increments a counter value
    content - Inserts generated content
    counter() or counters() function - Adds the value of a counter to an element


body {
  counter-reset: section;
}

h2::before {
  counter-increment: section;
  content: "Sec " counter(section) ": ";
}
